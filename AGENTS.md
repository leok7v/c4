# C4 Development Guide

## What is c4

c4 is a minimal self-compiling C compiler by Robert Swierczek. It compiles a subset of C
to bytecode and interprets it in a stack-based VM. The entire compiler fits in ~800 lines of C.
It can compile its own source: `./build/c4 c4.c test/struct_simple.c`.

## Architecture

### Type System (PTR=256 encoding)

| Type      | Encoding | Check                      |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------|
| CHAR      | 0        | `ty == CHAR`               |
| INT32     | 1        | `ty == INT32`              |
| INT64     | 2        | `ty == INT64`              |
| Structs   | 3..255   | `ty > INT64 && ty < PTR`   |
| CHAR*     | 256      | `ty >= PTR`                |
| INT32*    | 257      |                            |
| Struct A* | 259      |                            |
| CHAR**    | 512      |                            |

- Pointers: `ty >= PTR`. Strip one level: `ty - PTR`.
- Struct values: `ty > INT64 && ty < PTR`. Keep address in accumulator; no load.
- Struct lookup: `struct_syms[ty - INT64 - 1]` maps sequential ID to symbol table entry.

### Key Globals

- `e` — code emission pointer; `*++e = opcode` emits instructions
- `id` — current identifier (pointer into `sym_pool`, array of `Idsz=13` int64_t fields)
- `sym` — symbol table base
- `struct_syms` — array mapping struct IDs (0-252) to symbol entries
- `num_structs` — number of defined structs (max 253)
- `loc` — local variable frame offset set at function entry
- `i` — multipurpose counter / current local slot index
- `scope_sp` — scope stack pointer for block-scoped variable save/restore
- `brk_sp`, `cnt_sp` — break/continue patch stack pointers

### Symbol Table Fields (Idsz = 13)

`Tk, Hash, Name, Class, Type, Val, HClass, HType, HVal, Utyedef, Extent, Sline, Idsz`

- `Class` — `Fun`, `Sys`, `Glo`, `Loc`, or 0 (unbound)
- `Extent` — array size (0 for scalars). Arrays skip load in Id handler (address IS the value).
- `Sline` — for structs: linked list head of members `m[0]=hash, m[1]=type, m[2]=offset, m[3]=next`
- `Val` — for structs: total padded size in bytes; for locals/globals: address/offset

### Key Functions

- `next()` — lexer/tokenizer; sets `tk` and `id`
- `memacc()` — shared member access handler for `.` and `->` operators
- `expr(lev)` — expression parser with precedence climbing
- `stmt()` — statement parser
- `main()` — top-level declaration parser + VM interpreter

### Implemented Language Features

- Types: `char`, `int` (=int64_t), `int32_t`, `int64_t`, pointers, structs, arrays
- Control flow: `if`/`else`, `while`, `for`, `do`/`while`, `switch`/`case`/`default`
- Statements: `break`, `continue`, `return`
- Expressions: full precedence climbing, `sizeof`, casts, `++`/`--`, `->`, `.`, `[]`
- Scoped declarations: `{ int x = 0; }` and `for (int i = 0; ...)`
- Block-level variable declarations with initializers

## Build & Test

```sh
# Build
clang -o build/c4 c4.c -O3 -m64 -std=c11 -Wall

# Run individual tests
./build/c4 test/struct_simple.c
./build/c4 test/grok.c
./build/c4 test/loops.c

# Self-compilation test (c4 compiles itself, then runs a test)
timeout 10 ./build/c4 c4.c test/struct_simple.c

# Cross-check with system compiler
cc test/grok.c -o ./tmp/grok && ./tmp/grok

# Full test suite
./build/c4 test/test.c
```

### Temporary files

Use `./tmp/` (gitignored) for all temporary test files and debugging output — **not** `/tmp/`.
This avoids VSCode permission prompts and keeps scratch work in the project directory.

```sh
cc test/grok.c -o ./tmp/grok && ./tmp/grok
cat > ./tmp/mytest.c << 'EOF'
...
EOF
./build/c4 ./tmp/mytest.c
```

### Test Files

All test files include `<stdio.h>` so they compile with both c4 and cc/gcc/clang.

- `test/grok.c` — padding, sizeof(struct), cast, struct ptr arith
- `test/arrays.c` — all array types including struct arrays
- `test/loops.c` — for/while/do-while with break/continue, scoped for declarations
- `test/struct_ptr_arith.c` — pointer arithmetic, pre/post increment
- `test/struct_simple.c`, `test/struct_nested.c` — basic struct operations
- `test/int32_64.c` — int32_t/int64_t operations
- `test/io.c` — file I/O (open/read/write)
- `test/scope.c` — block-scoped declarations, init-in-declaration, (void) params
- `test/test.c` — test runner (discovers and runs all tests)

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — builds on ubuntu-latest with `clang -w` (suppresses Linux
int64_t format warnings), runs struct tests, io, self-compilation.

---

## Self-Compilation Constraints

`c4.c` must be valid c4 input. Now that c4 supports `for`/`do`/`break`/`continue`/`switch`,
these may be used in `c4.c` itself. Remaining constraints:

- **No forward references to globals** — declare before use
- **No mid-block variable declarations** — all locals at top of function or block
- **No `#define` macros** — c4 treats `#` as comment-to-EOL
- **No `unsigned`, `float`, `double`** — not implemented
- **No `&&` or `||` in variable declarations** — short-circuit not valid at decl site
- **`int` = `int64_t` (8 bytes)** — use `(int)` casts for printf `%d`
- **printf max 5 data arguments** — format + up to 5 values (6 total)
- **Always verify after changes**: `timeout 10 ./build/c4 c4.c test/struct_simple.c`

---

## Key Implementation Details

- `memacc()` handles both `.` and `->` member access (shared code path)
- Arrays use `id[Extent]` to store size; the Id handler skips the load (address is the value)
- Struct members stored as linked list: `m[0]=hash, m[1]=type, m[2]=offset, m[3]=next`
- Struct padding: members aligned to natural boundary; struct size padded to 8 bytes
- Postfix loop `while (tk == Brak || tk == '.' || tk == Arrow)` handles chaining like `pts[i].x`
- Postfix `Brak` must use `*++e = PSH` (append), never `*e = PSH` (replace)
- `break`/`continue` use global patch arrays (`brk_patches[]`, `cnt_patches[]`); each
  emits `JMP 0` and records the operand address; patches applied after loop exit
- `for` increment code is buffered (`inc_buf[128]`), rolled back, body emitted, then
  re-emitted — `continue` targets the re-emitted increment start
- Scoped `for (int j = ...)` uses `scope_stack` to save/restore the variable binding;
  restoration must use a local pointer (`d`), not the global `id`, to avoid clobbering
  the currently-parsed identifier

## Common Pitfalls

- Lexer maps `[` to `Brak` token (169), not ASCII `[` (91). Use `tk == Brak`, not `tk == '['`.
- `id` pointer changes after `next()` — save to local (`d`) before calling next() if needed.
- Element size must handle structs everywhere: Add, Sub, Inc, Dec, Brak (postfix and precedence).
- `PSH` pushes `a` without modifying it — subsequent `LI` reloads from address still in `a`.
- Scope restoration loops must use a local pointer variable, not the global `id`, so the
  currently-parsed identifier's entry is not overwritten.

## Future Plans

### Function Pointers

**Priority: HIGH**

Allow storing and calling functions through pointer variables.

**Design:**

- Type encoding: use a dedicated sentinel (e.g., `FNPTR = PTR + PTR`) or reuse `INT64 + PTR`
  with a flag. Simplest: treat function pointer as opaque `int64_t` holding a code address;
  mark with a new class `FnPtr` or reuse `Glo`/`Loc` with a special type.
- Storing a function address: `fp = myfunc;` emits `IMM <fun_address>` (like a global address).
- Indirect call opcode: add `JSRI` — pops the call address from the stack (or reads from `a`),
  pushes return address, jumps. VM: `sp = sp - 1; *sp = (int64_t)(pc + 1); pc = (int64_t *)*sp_arg;`
- Call syntax: `fp(args)` or `(*fp)(args)` — detect in `expr()` when an `Id` with function-pointer
  type is followed by `(`. Push args normally, then emit `PSH; JSRI` (push `fp` value, indirect call).
- Declaration syntax: `int (*fp)(int, int);` — parser extension for declarator with `(*)` inside.
  Minimal approach: `int *fp;` treated as function pointer when assigned a `Fun`-class identifier.

**New opcode required**: `JSRI` (indirect JSR via accumulator or top-of-stack).

**Estimated cost**: ~80 lines.

### Unsigned Integer Types (`uint32_t`, `uint64_t`)

**Priority: LOW**

- New opcodes for unsigned compare: `BLTU`, `BGTU`, `BLEU`, `BGEU`
- Unsigned division/modulo opcodes
- Logical (unsigned) right shift
- Type encoding to distinguish signed vs unsigned
- `%u` printf format support

**Estimated cost**: ~100 lines.

---

### Floating Point (`float`, `double`)

**Priority: LOW**

- New VM opcodes: `FADD`, `FSUB`, `FMUL`, `FDIV`, `FEQ`, `FNE`, `FLT`, `FGT`, `FLE`, `FGE`,
  `ITOF`, `FTOI`
- Literal parsing: `1.23`, `1e-5` in `next()`
- Type promotion rules (int op float → float)
- `%f` printf support
- Fundamental change to "everything is an integer" architecture.

**Estimated cost**: ~200–300 lines.

---

### `typedef` / `union`

**Priority: MEDIUM**

- `typedef`: alias for an existing type. Tokens already reserved. Cost: ~30 lines.
- `union`: overlapping member storage (all members at offset 0, size = largest member).
  Token already reserved. Cost: ~50 lines.

---

### Preprocessor Macros (`#define` with arguments)

**Priority: VERY LOW**

A full macro expander is nearly as complex as the compiler itself. Recommendation: keep
restricting to simple numeric constants, or use an external preprocessor (`cpp file.c | ./build/c4`).
